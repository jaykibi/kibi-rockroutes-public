<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I want this web map/app to help rock climbers to find sites they can visit and climb in the state of Colorado since it is a popular climbing destination. Mountain Project is a popular website that acts a rock climbing guide, but it is hard to navigate and it does not show a clear and clean looking map that is easy to follow.</p>
<p>RockRoutes will provide a clear visualization of the sites to climb. Users will be prompt to input the level of difficulty (grade) they are comfortable with, what type of climbing they want to do (boulder, ice, etc.), and the pitches (ascent of routes, the more pitch, the higher the wall/rock is). Their input will then generate a map that clearly plots what the users were looking for to climb. When they click the dot which notifies the location of a site on the map, I envision a pop-up window on the map itself which will have all the details of the site (name, address/coordinates, picture, descriptions). The users can click the link provided in the pop-up to check out Mountain Project’s more detailed webpage on the specific rock climbing site they are interested in. Additionally, the web map/app will provide a quick and concise explanations on what “grade”, “pitch”, and the different types of sites/rocks to climb (basically the definition of rock climbing lingos used that users might not be familiar with).</p>
As an extra bonus, and if we have time and the skills to do it - it would be cool to provide a few 3D map of the popular sites and also weather updates on the locations they choose.</p>

<h2>Usefulness</h2>

<p>This website will help hany rock climbers who just want a fast way to look at a visual data (a map) of all the routes available for them to climb in the state of Colorado. RockRoutes will have the clear and clean look that help users to input their preferences easily and get what they are looking for after they click submit.</p>
<ul>
  <h4>Benefits:</h4>
  <li>Clean website that is to the point</li>
  <li>Way of finding new routes according the input from the user</li>
  </ul>
  
<h4>What does a "successful" web map and/or app do?</h4>
<p>It is successful when it can take in the users’ input and show the sites they asked to see and be able to provide more information on each sites through the pop-up boxes.</p>

<h2>Novelty</h2>
<p>Currently, Mountain Project has mapped their sites. But since they have so many rock climbing sites mapped (sometimes they’re very close to each other) - they look very clustered and hard to follow/click. This is why I want to create something that is more specific and cleaner looking. Mountain Project is also mainly about rock climbing guides and it does not prioritize the map they have. My web map/app will prioritize the map and visualizations of the rock climbing sites.</p>

<p>Example of Mountain Project’s map.
<h4>How is yours different or better?</h4>
<p>This web map/app will prioritize visualization and make sure that the users can figure it out easily and they can get the information they were looking for quickly.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<h4>What is your web map and/or app going to look like? What are your screens? What is your navigation? How does a user use your web map and/or app, start to finish?</h4>
<p>The website would look something like this. But on the left side of this home page, we will have a box which will look similar as below (taken from Mountain Project’s website as a preview):</p>

<p>**image in video**<p>
<p>The navigation on top of the home page reads “Home”, “Map”, “Climbing Info”, and “Meet the team”. The “Home” page is pretty self-explanatory, the “Map” page will be displaying all the possible routes we have in our database, the “Climbing Info” will have the details of what grades, pitches, different types of climbing are, and lastly the “Meet the team” is a page of our team and it can be changed if needed.</p>

<p>The map page would be like Mountain Project’s, but it would be far less cluttered. When the dots are clicked, it will show the details of the routes, which will also link to MP’s more detailed webpage of the site/route.

<h2>Data</h2>
<h4>What data do you need? What data will you collect? Where will the data you collect go?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Basemap:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Geological map of Colorado</li>
      <li>Possibly 3D geological map of a few sites in Colorado</li>
     </ul>
  <li>Data:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Climbing routes data from Mountain Project and other similar sites, which includes:</li>
        <ul>
         <li>Grades</li>
         <li>Type: ice, trad, sport, toprope, etc.</li>
         <li>Pitches</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Locations (which part of CO)</li>
     </ul>
</ul>
<p>The data will be collected from Mountain Project and similar web-based route pages.</p>

<h2>Implementation Tasks</h2>
<h4>Team's schedule</h4>
<ul>
  <li><h6>Week 01:</h6> Compose route and sites data in CO from Moutain Project and similar sites</li>
  <li><h6>Week 02:</h6> Continute composing route and sites data ++ Find basemaps of CO that we can use</li>
  <li><h6>Week 03:</h6> Spring Break - continue previous week's work or start next week's work</li>
  <li><h6>Week 04:</h6> Start working on map ++ find and collect additional data to the sites (pictures, additional web info, etc.)</li>
  <li><h6>Week 05:</h6> Continue working on map ++ start working on web map/app</li>
  <li><h6>Week 06:</h6> Continue working on web map/app</li>
  <li><h6>Week 07:</h6> Continue working on web map/app ++ early stages testing for 5 users</li>
  <li><h6>Week 08:</h6> Continue working on web map/app and finish before the weekend! ++ test final product during the weekend!</li>
  <li><h6>Week 09:</h6> PROJECT PRESENTATION!</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<h4>What do you plan to have tested, by when? What is your plan for testing?</h4>
<p>As stated on the week planning, we aim to test our app by the 7th week, and continue testing the following week.</p>

<h4>Who will test?</h4>
<p>Friends/fellow Ags who are interested in or have been climbing in Colorado</p>

<h4>How many people will test it?</h4>
<p>At least 15-20 people/climbers</p>

<h4>What are your test cases?</h4>
<p>When climbers want to find places to go to. To prep for a trip or while on the road.<p>
<p>Special cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When the users do not have too good of data receptions</li>
  <li>When users are in a rush</li>
</ul>

<h4>How will you know if your answer is correct?</h4>
<p>When the user is satisfied and have found what they’re looking for; and if not, there should be an indication that the data is not available.</p>
